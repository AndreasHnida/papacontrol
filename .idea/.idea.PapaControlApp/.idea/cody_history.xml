                      <text value="Based on the provided code and context, it appears that the `_allowedTime` value is being read from the settings file correctly in the `LoadSettings()` method. However, if you're observing that it's being reset to an old value, there could be a few reasons for this:&#10;&#10;1. The `SaveSettings()` method might not be called at the right times, or there might be an issue with saving the updated value.&#10;&#10;2. There could be a race condition where the old value is being set after the new value has been saved.&#10;&#10;3. The `_allowedTime` property might be getting reset somewhere else in the code that we haven't seen.&#10;&#10;To troubleshoot this, you could add more debug logging around where `_allowedTime` is being set and saved. Also, check if there are any other places in the code where `_allowedTime` is being modified.&#10;&#10;If you're sure that the correct value is being saved but not loaded, you might want to double-check the encryption/decryption process to ensure that the data is being stored and retrieved correctly." />

                      <text value="ok, so i really don't understand this. _allowedTime holds the correct value when saved. but, when read from settings.dat it does not get loaded correctly. if i delete settings.dat than it is still set to about 11h. it should be set to its default value then. which is &amp;quot;1h&amp;quot;. i am confused." />

                      <text value="I understand your confusion. Let's analyze this step by step:&#10;&#10;1. The default value of `_allowedTime` is set to &quot;1h&quot; in the class declaration.&#10;&#10;2. When `settings.dat` exists, the `LoadSettings()` method reads and sets the `_allowedTime` value correctly.&#10;&#10;3. If `settings.dat` is deleted, you're seeing `_allowedTime` set to about 11h instead of the expected default &quot;1h&quot;.&#10;&#10;This behavior suggests that there might be another place in the code where `_allowedTime` is being set, possibly during initialization or in a constructor that we haven't seen.&#10;&#10;To resolve this, you could:&#10;&#10;1. Add more debug logging in the constructor and `Initialize()` method to track when and where `_allowedTime` is being set.&#10;&#10;2. Check if there are any other methods or properties that might be modifying `_allowedTime` during startup.&#10;&#10;3. Ensure that the default value is being set correctly in all possible initialization paths.&#10;&#10;4. Consider adding a fallback in `LoadSettings()` to explicitly set `_allowedTime` to &quot;1h&quot; if the file doesn't exist or can't be read.&#10;&#10;By adding more detailed logging and carefully tracing the execution flow, you should be able to pinpoint where the unexpected 11h value is coming from." />
